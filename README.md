# Rummikub – C++ Console Project
A simple text-based implementation of the Rummikub game, created for the Introduction to Programming 2025 course.
The project follows only the concepts taught in class (arrays, functions, pointers, dynamic memory, basic I/O) 
and is built as a Visual Studio console application because it gives me access to all the resources I need.


**Plan for development:**
**1.** Tile engine (tile representation, shuffle, draw...)
**2.** Players (racks, drawing tiles, basic info)
**3.** Table (runs/groups)
**4.** Rules (sets validation, counting points,first 30)
**5.** Game loop + UI (menus, turns, win conditions)
**Potentially** Save/load system

**According to the requirements that are yet to be known, I plan on adding these files:**
> constants.h (all the globals)
> tiles.cpp / tiles.h (pool mechanics and everything that works on the tiles)
> players.cpp / players.h (rack mechanics and first 30)
> table.cpp / table.h (runs and groups)
> rules.cpp / rules.h (checks for different rules)
> game.cpp / game.h (turn logic)
> main.cpp (keeps everything connected)
