# Rummikub – C++ Console Project
A simple text-based implementation of the Rummikub game, created for the Introduction to Programming 2025 course.
The project follows only the concepts taught in class (arrays, functions, pointers, dynamic memory, basic I/O) 
and is built as a Visual Studio console application because it gives me access to all the resources I need.

**Plan for development:**
**1.** Tile engine (tile representation, shuffle, draw...)</br>
**2.** Players (racks, drawing tiles, basic info)</br>
**3.** Table (runs/groups)</br>
**4.** Rules (sets validation, counting points,first 30)</br>
**5.** Game loop + UI (menus, turns, win conditions)</br>
**Potentially** Save/load system</br>
</br>
**According to the requirements that are yet to be known, I plan on adding these files:**</br>
+ constants.h (all the globals)</br>
+ tiles.cpp / tiles.h (pool mechanics and everything that works on the tiles)</br>
+ players.cpp / players.h (rack mechanics and first 30)</br>
+ table.cpp / table.h (runs and groups)</br>
+ rules.cpp / rules.h (checks for different rules)</br>
+ game.cpp / game.h (turn logic)</br>
+ main.cpp (keeps everything connected)</br>
</br>
